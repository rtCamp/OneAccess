## Overview

OneAccess is a centralized user management solution designed for enterprises managing multiple WordPress sites. It streamlines user creation, role assignment, and profile management across multiple WordPress installations by providing a single governing interface to manage users on all connected brand sites.

## Description

**OneAccess** is a centralized user manager for WordPress. From a single governing site, you can:

* **Create and manage users** across multiple WordPress sites simultaneously  
* **Assign and modify user roles** on selected sites with granular control  
* **Handle profile update requests** with approval workflows  
* **Bulk operations** for user management across multiple sites  
* **Secure API communication** between governing and brand sites

This makes it easier to maintain consistent user access, roles, and profiles across all your WordPress environments while ensuring proper approval workflows for sensitive changes.

## Why OneAccess?

Managing users across multiple WordPress sites in enterprise environments is a complex and time-consuming process. Manual user creation, role assignment, and profile updates across different sites can lead to:

- Inconsistent user access across sites  
- Administrative overhead and human errors  
- Lack of centralized control over user permissions  
- No approval workflow for profile changes

OneAccess solves this by:

- **Centralizing User Management:** Single governing site to manage users across all brand sites  
- **Automated User Provisioning:** Create users and assign roles to multiple sites simultaneously  
- **Approval Workflows:** Controlled profile update process with admin approval  
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Custom roles for governing and brand site administration  
- **Secure Communication:** All operations use nonce and secure API keys via WordPress REST API

### Key Benefits

- **Reduced Administrative Overhead:** Manage all users from a single dashboard  
- **Consistent User Experience:** Ensure uniform access and roles across all sites

### Workflow Overview

1. **Installation Phase:** Install OneAccess on governing site and all brand sites  
2. **Configuration Phase:** Set site types and configure brand sites to connect with governing site  
3. **User Management:** Network Admin manages users through governing site dashboard  
4. **Profile Requests:** Users and Brand Admins submit profile change requests  
5. **Approval Process:** Network Admin reviews and approves/rejects profile changes  
6. **Synchronization:** All changes are synchronized across connected sites via secure API

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How are users synchronized between sites?

Users are synchronized using WordPress REST API with secure authentication. All operations are performed in real-time with immediate updates across connected sites.

### Can brand site admins create users directly?

No, all user creation must be done through the governing site to maintain consistency and central control.

### What happens if a profile request is rejected?

When a profile request is rejected, the Network Admin can add comments explaining the rejection. These comments are visible to the user, who can then make necessary changes and resubmit the request.

### Can users edit their profiles while a request is pending?

No, when a profile update request is pending, all profile editing is disabled until the request is approved or rejected by the Network Admin.

### How are passwords handled for new users?

Passwords can be manually entered or auto-generated using the strong password generator. The system enforces password strength requirements and provides options to show/hide passwords during creation.

### Can I remove users from specific sites only?

Yes, you can remove users from selective sites while maintaining their access on other sites. This provides granular control over user access across your site network.

## Troubleshooting

### Users Not Appearing on Brand Sites

- Verify API key configuration on brand sites  
- Check network connectivity between governing and brand sites  
- Confirm REST API endpoints are accessible  
- Ensure proper user roles (Network Admin/Brand Admin)

### Profile Requests Not Working

- Verify nonce validation is working correctly  
- Check API key permissions and configuration  
- Confirm user roles and capabilities  
- Review WordPress REST API functionality

### Connection Issues Between Sites

- **API Key Errors:** Regenerate and reconfigure API keys  
- **Network Connectivity:** Test direct connection between sites  
- **WordPress REST API:** Ensure REST API is enabled and accessible  
- **SSL/HTTPS Issues:** Verify secure connections if using HTTPS

### Common Issues

- **Role Assignment Failures:** Check user capabilities and site permissions  
- **Bulk Operation Timeouts:** Consider processing smaller batches for large user sets  
- **Profile Lock Issues:** Clear pending requests or approve/reject to unlock profiles  
- **Site Connection Failures:** Verify governing site URL and API configuration
