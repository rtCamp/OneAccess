Centralized user management: create, manage, and control user access across multiple WordPress sites from one governing site.

== Description ==

OneAccess is a powerful user management solution designed for enterprises managing multiple WordPress sites. It provides centralized user creation, role assignment, and profile management across multiple WordPress installations through a single governing interface with approval workflows.

**Why OneAccess?**

Managing users across multiple WordPress sites in enterprise environments is complex and time-consuming. Manual user creation, role assignment, and profile updates across different sites can lead to inconsistent user access, administrative overhead, and lack of centralized control.

OneAccess solves this by providing a single governing site to manage users across all connected brand sites, with secure API communication and approval workflows for sensitive changes.

**Key Benefits:**

* **Reduced Administrative Overhead:** Manage all users from a single dashboard
* **Consistent User Experience:** Ensure uniform access and roles across all sites
* **Enhanced Security:** Approval workflows prevent unauthorized profile changes
* **Scalable Architecture:** Handle users across unlimited number of sites

**Core Features:**

* **Centralized User Dashboard:** Comprehensive interface for user management operations
* **Multi-Site User Creation:** Create users and assign to multiple sites in one action
* **Role Management:** Assign and modify user roles on selective sites
* **Profile Request System:** Approval workflow for user profile updates
* **Site-Selective Actions:** Target specific sites for user operations

**User Management Actions:**

* Create new users with customizable roles across selected sites
* Modify user roles on existing sites or assign users to new sites
* Remove users from selective sites while maintaining access on others
* Review and approve/reject profile update requests
* Perform bulk operations across multiple sites
* Manage user access with granular site-specific control

**Security Features:**

* **Secure API Communication:** All operations use WordPress REST API with nonce validation
* **API Key Authentication:** Unique API keys for secure site-to-site communication
* **Role-Based Permissions:** Custom user roles (Network Admin, Brand Admin) with specific capabilities
* **Approval Workflows:** Controlled process for sensitive profile changes

**Perfect for:**

* Enterprise WordPress deployments with multiple sites
* Organizations requiring centralized user management
* Companies with strict user approval processes
* Agencies managing multiple client sites
* Educational institutions with multiple campus sites

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How are users synchronized between sites? =

Users are synchronized using WordPress REST API with secure authentication. All operations are performed in real-time with immediate updates across connected sites.

= Can brand site admins create users directly? =

No, all user creation must be done through the governing site to maintain consistency and central control.

= What happens if a profile request is rejected? =

When a profile request is rejected, the Network Admin can add comments explaining the rejection. These comments are visible to the user, who can then make necessary changes and resubmit the request.

= Can users edit their profiles while a request is pending? =

No, when a profile update request is pending, all profile editing is disabled until the request is approved or rejected by the Network Admin.

= How are passwords handled for new users? =

Passwords can be manually entered or auto-generated using the strong password generator. The system enforces password strength requirements and provides options to show/hide passwords during creation.

= Can I remove users from specific sites only? =

Yes, you can remove users from selective sites while maintaining their access on other sites. This provides granular control over user access across your site network.

= Does this work with WordPress multisite? =

OneAccess is designed to work across multiple separate WordPress installations. It's different from WordPress multisite - it connects independent WordPress sites through secure API communication.

= Is there a limit to how many sites I can manage? =

There are no hard limits on the number of brand sites you can connect to your governing site.

= What user roles are created by OneAccess? =

OneAccess creates two custom roles: Network Admin (for governing site administration) and Brand Admin (for brand site administration).
